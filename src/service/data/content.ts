          'A CRM is where your business keeps its relationships: every lead, customer, job, quote, and follow-up. The big subscription CRMs assume your business works like everyone else’s, then charge per seat, per month, forever, for a system where most of the buttons are for somebody else. A custom CRM flips that: your pipeline stages, your fields, your reports, your language, with nothing you don’t use. Around it we build the rest of the toolkit, portals where customers log in and get things done, dashboards that pull scattered data into one honest picture, and integrations that make your existing tools talk to each other.',
          'Hark Digital has been building CRMs and business software for Philadelphia companies since 2016, for trucking firms, medical practices, manufacturers, real estate companies, and nonprofits. The pattern is almost always the same: the customer list lives in a spreadsheet being emailed around, follow-ups live in someone’s head, and answering “where does this job stand?” takes three phone calls. That is exactly where a custom CRM pays for itself.',

A custom CRM wins when the workflow is the business: the way you quote jobs, schedule crews, intake patients, or track freight. If you have ever bent your process to fit a subscription tool, or you are paying every month for features nobody opens, that gap is where custom software starts earning. And unlike a subscription, you own it: no per-seat math, no rate hikes, no losing your data when you cancel.',

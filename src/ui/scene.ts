/*
 * Reference-counted "the scene is covered" holds. The phone-landscape rotate
 * card and the mobile menu sheet each stop the WebGL frame while they cover
 * it: the engine skips rendering (engine.paused), the last frame stays
 * behind the frosted sheet, perfectly still, and an unseen scene never burns
 * battery. Two covers can overlap (a phone turned sideways with the menu
 * open); the scene only runs again once both have let go.
 *
 * Holds may be taken before the engine exists; they apply once bindScene()
 * runs.
